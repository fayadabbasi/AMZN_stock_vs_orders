# AMZN_stock_vs_orders

Super simple analysis - what would happen if I had bought Amazon stock instead of purchases I made on Amazon. 

Amazon provides historical purchase information on their site so I looked at the date of purchase and amount, and then 
compared that to the stock price and acquired partial shares of stock.
